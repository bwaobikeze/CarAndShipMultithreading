# CarAndShipMultithreading

## Description

The Drawbridge Project is a simulation program designed to mimic the traffic scenario around a drawbridge. The program simulates the movement of cars and ships, highlighting the challenges of managing traffic flow when a drawbridge is involved. The project employs POSIX threads and C++'s multithreading library to execute various processes concurrently, closely resembling real-world traffic conditions.

## Developer

- **Duration:** Feb 2023 - Mar 2023

## Features

- The project focuses on simulating the interaction between cars and ships at a drawbridge.
- POSIX threads are utilized to enable parallel execution of different processes, mirroring the real-time behavior of traffic flow.
- A vehicle object is implemented to represent both car and ship types, each executing its unique thread routines.
- The simulation provides insights into managing complex traffic scenarios and understanding multithreading concepts.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the drawbridge simulation program.
2. The program will simulate the movement of cars and ships around the drawbridge.
3. Observe how the processes run concurrently, mimicking the real traffic flow around a drawbridge.

## Implementation Details

- POSIX threads are used to achieve parallelism in the simulation.
- The vehicle object represents both car and ship types, with distinct thread routines for each type.
- The project demonstrates the challenges of handling traffic scenarios involving multiple vehicle types.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of more advanced traffic management algorithms for a more realistic simulation.
- Visualization tools to provide a graphical representation of the traffic flow.
